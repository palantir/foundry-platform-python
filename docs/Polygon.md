# Polygon

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**bbox** | **List\[float\]** | A GeoJSON object MAY have a member named \&quot;bbox\&quot; to include information on the coordinate range for its Geometries, Features, or FeatureCollections. The value of the bbox member MUST be an array of length 2\*n where n is the number of dimensions represented in the contained geometries, with all axes of the most southwesterly point followed by all axes of the more northeasterly point. The axes order of a bbox follows the axes order of geometries.  | \[optional\]
**coordinates** | **List\[List\[List\[float\]\]\]** |  | \[optional\]
**type** | **str** |  |

## Example

```python
from foundry.models import Polygon

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Polygon from a JSON string
polygon_instance = Polygon.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Polygon.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
polygon_dict = polygon_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Polygon from a dict
polygon_form_dict = polygon.from_dict(polygon_dict)
```
