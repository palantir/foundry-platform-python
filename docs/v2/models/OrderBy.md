# OrderBy

A command representing the list of properties to order by. Properties should be delimited by commas and
prefixed by `p` or `properties`. The format expected format is
`orderBy=properties.{property}:{sortDirection},properties.{property}:{sortDirection}...`

By default, the ordering for a property is ascending, and this can be explicitly specified by appending 
`:asc` (for ascending) or `:desc` (for descending).

Example: use `orderBy=properties.lastName:asc` to order by a single property, 
`orderBy=properties.lastName,properties.firstName,properties.age:desc` to order by multiple properties. 
You may also use the shorthand `p` instead of `properties` such as `orderBy=p.lastName:asc`.
