# Compressed

Compression helps reduce the size of the data being sent, resulting in lower network usage and
storage, at the cost of some additional CPU usage for compression and decompression. This stream type
is only recommended if your stream contains a high volume of repetitive strings and is experiencing poor
network bandwidth symptoms like non-zero lag, lower than expected throughput, or dropped records.


## Type
```python
pydantic.StrictBool
