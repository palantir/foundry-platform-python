# ObjectSetAsBaseObjectTypesType

Casts the objects in the object set to their base type and thus ensures objects are returned with all of their
properties in the resulting object set, not just the properties that implement interface properties. This is 
currently unsupported and an exception will be thrown if used.


## Properties
