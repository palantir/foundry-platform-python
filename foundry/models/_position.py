Position = List[Coordinate]
"""
GeoJSon fundamental geometry construct.

A position is an array of numbers. There MUST be two or more elements.
The first two elements are longitude and latitude, precisely in that order and using decimal numbers.
Altitude or elevation MAY be included as an optional third element.

Implementations SHOULD NOT extend positions beyond three elements
because the semantics of extra elements are unspecified and ambiguous.
Historically, some implementations have used a fourth element to carry
a linear referencing measure (sometimes denoted as "M") or a numerical
timestamp, but in most situations a parser will not be able to properly
interpret these values. The interpretation and meaning of additional
elements is beyond the scope of this specification, and additional
elements MAY be ignored by parsers.
