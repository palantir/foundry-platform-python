"""
Import mode governs how raw files are read from an external system, and written into a Foundry dataset. 

SNAPSHOT: Defines a new dataset state consisting only of files from a particular import execution.
APPEND: Purely additive and yields data from previous import executions in addition to newly added files.
UPDATE: Replaces existing files from previous import executions based on file names.
